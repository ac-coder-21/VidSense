text = """ okay so it actually tells me how far my

Uber ride is

all right so after all the hype after

all the leaks and rumors we finally have

our hands on the nothing phone too and

we also have the last year's nothing

phone one with us and we have used it

for many days though the overall phone

experience of phone one is good it does

have some room for improvement and that

is where the new nothing phone 2 comes

in because on paper it has improved

software better camera and a more

functional glyph interface you know

glyph interface

so the question that has to be asked is

what is the difference between the phone

one and phone 2 and most importantly in

this video due to the Embargo we can

only limited things I know it's just

but I'm excited let's go now I love

unboxing nothing devices they have a

very unique approach so see here you get

this big Square package and you just

steer it off inside there is the main

box oh and it has this really cool

texture on it seems like Braille but

it's not just doing this feels

satisfying whatever it is actually Brave

no it's not Braille it should mean

something

and it opens like a book wow this looks

so neat and clean and minimal you have

the phone wrapped in paper over here you

have some paperwork then you have a

unique looking Sim ejector tool and this

types you to type c cable it has that

see-through design now we at Tech visor

have unboxed so many phones and I would

say nothing unboxing feels different and

fresh now I would say there are three

key differences from the nothing phone

one and the first would be design like

at first glance it might seem that the

phone 2 is similar to the phone one and

even if I keep the nothing phone one and

phone two side by side just by soul

looks it would be very hard to tell the

difference the bezels and all they look

the same and when you pick up the phone

the in hand feel feels different and

that's because here on the back the

glass has a curved design on the phone

one it is flat so holding the phone is

more comfortable now like it fits in the

Palm pretty well also I'm happy that

this stuck with the glyph light on the

nothing phone 2 and worked on it I mean

the glyph interface is slightly

different now see on the phone one this

entire area was just one continuous

segment but now on the phone two see it

is divided into several segments this

makes the glyph more functional more on

this in just a moment other than this

you get the same metal frame and hang on

let me see if it can stand on its own oh

yes it can independent

yes my only concern is that the back is

slightly slippery and it does attract a

lot of fingerprints also we have had

this for about three days now and come

close see it has already some scratches

on the back now you don't get any back

cover included so you will have to buy

it separately or go with this white

variant it should hide the fingerprint

and scratch it slightly overall I would

say there's nothing see-through design

it makes the phone unique and stands out

in public moving on to the front you get

a 6.7 inch full HD Plus 120 hertz AMOLED

display also you get an in-display

fingerprint scanner which is pretty fast

and accurate now the second and the

biggest difference is in performance see

last year's nothing phone one came with

a mid-range chip Snapdragon 778g plus

but nothing phone 2 comes with a

flagship Snapdragon 8 plus genuine

processor of course last year's Flagship

processor but this changes the whole

approach of the nothing phone series now

it's entering the flagship territory

like

OnePlus so you get 12 GB lpddr5 Ram 512

GB ufs 3.1 storage the base variant

starts from 8 128gb which is fine so did

the nothing phone one now we ran

everyone's favorite n22 Benchmark and

well the difference is quite evident the

nothing phone one scores somewhere

around six and a half lakh whereas the

nothing phone 2 scores more than 11 lakh

that's like almost two times the

performance jump so yeah from the

performance standpoint I would say the

nothing phone 2 is a big upgrade over

the nothing phone one and the third key

difference would be this glyph interface

so nothing's glyph interface is already

unique like no other smartphone has

anything like this but it had very

limited feature in nothing phone one

like you could just flip the phone like

this it goes to DND it lights up when

you receive a call or message it shows

charging status when you just shake it

like this but now nothing has added some

extra functionality to it let me show

you first this is the glyph timer so

I'll just set the timer for one minute

and now see only this portion lights up

like a physical progress bar or the

small red LED over here see if I record

a video it blinks they have made it

bigger this time I'll come to the camera

in just a moment and then for you

creative people out there you get this

composer option so you can create your

own sound and the glyph light will match

accordingly let me make a cool ringtone

you want to listen to my ringtone

are you ready

okay it's a masterpiece

see I'll call an Uber

Uber now my ride is confirmed and see on

the glyph interface I can actually see

how far my ride is and now the progress

bar is filled but where is my ride oh so

we have to wait like one more minute

because it's just 500 100 meter far away

and now it is 100 filled and see there

is our right I would say the

implementation can get better with

software updates now nothing promises to

bring this feature to zomato as well in

the future with updates so we'll wait

for that update and we'll see how useful

this feature is later on overall I would

say nothing has worked on the hardware

as well as on their software game to

make the entire glyph interface more

functional and useful speaking of

software I really like what nothing has

done here like every time I use a new

phone the first thing that I do is

change the wallpaper but here I just

love this black and white wallpaper it

just goes so well with the whole

aesthetic of the phone other than this

this is running Android 13 right out of

the box nothing has their own skin which

they call the nothing OS 2.0 and this is

very close to stock Android like see

here on the App Drawer there is

practically zero blue where plus you get

additional nothing OS touches here and

there for instance if I long press on

this icon I can enlarge it and then

there is this double press to launch

camera which is quick and simple more

brands should do that but here's my

favorite one see if I bring down the

notification tray there is this torch

option here this is common right but now

if I press and hold it see it turns on

the glyph light nice kind of a hidden

Easter egg now on the camera side of

things well you get a 50 megapixel main

camera now we are not supposed to give

you an opinion on camera samples wow but

here are some camera samples these are

the few pictures from the main camera

like Delhi has been a mess due to range

now there is also a 50 megapixel Ultra

wide angle camera and again here are a

few samples people usually take

landscape photos with the ultra wide so

that's what we did also the ultra wide

angle doubles as a macro camera so we

took quite a lot of photos of flowers

and this picture of water droplets on

the leaf let me know in the comment

section which photo you liked coming to

videos well you can shoot maximum 4k

60fps on the rear camera on the front

you get a 16 megapixel selfie camera

which can record maximum 1080p 60 FPS

like come on it's 2023 threads reached 1

million followers in just one hour and

we still don't have 4K on the front

camera come on here are some selfie

photos besides this you get a bigger

4700 milliamp hour battery this year

plus it supports 33 watts of wired

charging also you get 15 watts of

wireless charging plus 5 Watts for

reverse wireless charging and you get

all the necessary sensors including NFC

now to answer the question how is it

different from nothing phone one see the

major difference comes in the price

point nothing phone one had a Snapdragon

778g plus processor which was a

mid-range processor so it launched for

around 30 32 000 but people mostly

bought it around 27 29 000 but this new

nothing phone 2 has the Snapdragon 8

plus gen1 a more refined software better

camera specs so I'm expecting the price

to be around 40 000 or even more and

that price it also competes with the

OnePlus 11R pixel 7A that comparison

would be very interesting and now I

think they're finally in that Flagship

territory so that was the first look of

the new nothing phone too let us know in

the comment section which phone would

you like us to compare with or you have

any questions we'll try to cover it in

the comparison or the full review on

that note this is pratik signing off see

you in the next video and pew pew pew
